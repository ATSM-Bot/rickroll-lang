# Be Awareâš 
- This repo is not completed yet, this language only supports "defining variables", "print" and "if statement"
- We are currently working on or achieving "loop"
- We are using GitHub as a source code manager (I don't usually use git ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜‚)

# Language Documentation
A rick roll oriented, dynamic, strong, interpreting esoteric programming language.

## Execute Code Command
> I usually execute my source code like this:
```
python3 rick.py -s [Source Code File Name]
```
> If you want to know the execution time:
```
python3 rick.py -s [Source Code File Name] -time
```
> The interpreter can generate a .mp3 file from your source code (This feature is not completed yet)
```
python3 rick.py -s [Source Code File Name] -mp3
```
> Also the interpreter provides you to "sing" code (This feature is not completed yet)
```
python3 rick.py -sing [MP3 File Name] [Source Code(Text) File Name]
```


## Hello World
```
take_me_to_ur_heart                           # This is the MAIN METHOD
    give_u_up msg = "Hello, World!"           # Define a variable, its value is hello world
    i_just_wanna_tell_u_how_im_feeling: msg   # print the "msg" variable
never_let_me_go                               # End the main method
```
And you can get the output on your terminal:
```
Hello, World!
```

## If Statement
```
take_me_to_ur_heart
    give_u_up a = 10

    and_if_u_ask_me_how_im_feeling a is 10
        i_just_wanna_tell_u_how_im_feeling: "A is 10!"
    say_good_bye

never_let_me_go
```
And you can get this on your terminal:
```
"A is 10!"
```
