```
> If you want to know the execution time:
```
python3 rick.py -s [Source Code File Name] -time
```
> The interpreter can generate a .mp3 file from your source code (This feature is not completed yet)
```
python3 rick.py -s [Source Code File Name] -mp3
```
> Also the interpreter provides you to "sing" code (This feature is not completed yet)
```
python3 rick.py -sing [MP3 File Name] [Source Code(Text) File Name]

## Hello World
```
take_me_to_ur_heart                           # This is the MAIN METHOD
    give_u_up msg = "Hello, World!"           # Define a variable, its value is hello world
    i_just_wanna_tell_u_how_im_feeling: msg   # print the "msg" variable
this_old_house_is_where_u_should_be         # End the main method
# End                                         # End the whole program
```
And you can get the output on your terminal:

    say_good_bye
