A rick roll oriented, dynamic, strong, interpreting esoteric programming language.

# Hello World
```
take_me_to_ur_heart                           # This is the MAIN METHOD
    give_u_up msg = "Hello, World!"           # Define a variable, its value is hello world
    i_just_wanna_tell_u_how_im_feeling: msg   # print the "msg" variable
this_old_house_is_the_way_u_should_be         # End the main method
# End                                         # End the whole program
```
And you can get the output on your terminal:
```
Hello, World!
```
